Introduction
This is a simple Node.js web application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customers. It uses Express.js as the web framework and MongoDB as the database. The app also includes validation using the Joi library.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Node.js
MongoDB
Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code
Navigate to the root directory of the app in your terminal
Run npm install to install the dependencies
Start the MongoDB server by running mongod in a separate terminal window
Start the app by running npm start
Usage
Once the app is running, you can use a REST client such as Postman to interact with it. Here are the available routes:

GET /api/customers - Returns all customers in the database
GET /api/customers/:id - Returns a single customer by ID
POST /api/customers - Creates a new customer
PUT /api/customers/:id - Updates a customer by ID
To use these routes, send a request to the appropriate URL using the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT), and include any necessary data in the request body or URL parameters.

Tests
To run the tests, follow these steps:

Navigate to the root directory of the app in your terminal
Run npm test to run the tests
The tests use the Mocha and Chai libraries. They test the app's functionality using mocked data and an in-memory MongoDB database.

Conclusion
That's it! You now have a working Node.js web application that provides CRUD operations for customers using Express.js and MongoDB.
